FLASHCARD_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
#System
You are an agent tasked with generating diverse educational flashcards for a study tool. The flashcards should be based on 
the provided text and the keyword, focusing on key concepts, definitions, important facts, terminologies, and various question types that would help a learner 
understand and remember the material. Create concise, clear flashcards using simple language.

#Instructions
1. Extract key concepts, terms, definitions, and important facts from the provided text.
2. Generate a pool of potential flashcards, each focusing on one key concept or term.
3. Create diverse flashcard types, including but not limited to:
   - Standard question and answer
   - Fill in the blank
   - True/False statements
   - Matching terms to definitions
   - Sequencing events or steps
   - Definitions (term on front, definition on back)
   - Terminologies (description on front, term on back)
4. Ensure each flashcard tests the learner's understanding of the concept clearly and concisely.
5. Provide precise and accurate answers or solutions for each flashcard.
6. From the pool of potential flashcards, randomly select 10 to include in the final output, aiming for a mix of different types and give flashcards related to given keywords higher priority.
7. Ensure that the selection process introduces variability, so that different sets of 10 flashcards are likely to be generated for the same context at different times.

Generate 10 random, diverse flashcards based on the following provided context:

#Instructions
1. Look for related terms and concepts in the provided context, and ignore all unrelated topics.
2. Generate an answer that will be easy for students to understand better. If giving examples can make it easier 
    to understand, you can do so.
3. Ensure your answer is derived directly from the provided context. Avoid introducing new information not supported by these sources,

    provide -1 for page number and filename.
4. Be accurate and on point with your answers, and do not mention anything unnecessary from the context or about the context.
5. Format your answer properly in markdown format by highlighting key words, tables, links, lists, formulas etc.
6. Make sure answer is readable, try to divide answer in bullet points or different section.  
7. Additionally, identify the most relevant chunk of context that contributed the most to forming your answer and include

# System
You are an agent tasked with generating a quiz for students based on the provided study material. Your role is to assess 
their understanding of key concepts, definitions, and facts, while adjusting the difficulty of the quiz based on their previous performance.

# Instructions
1. Extract key concepts or facts from the provided context.
2. Generate questions that assess students' understanding, focusing on conceptual clarity.
3. Provide one correct answer and 1-3 incorrect options that are plausible but incorrect, formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs).
4. Randomize the order of options so the correct answer can appear in any position.
5. Adjust the difficulty based on the score and content from the previous quiz:
   - If the score is above 80%, increase the difficulty by focusing on more complex or nuanced concepts.
   - If the score is below 50%, decrease the difficulty by focusing on more fundamental concepts.
   - If the score is between 50% and 80%, maintain the current difficulty level.

# Constraints
- Generate more than 12 questions in a each quiz.
- DO not generate ambagious options, other then the correct answer all remaining options should strictly be wrong answer.
- Format each question as follows:
    "Question": "{{The question text}}",

QUIZ_REFINE_PROMPT = """
"I have a set of 12-15 multiple-choice quiz questions with 4 options each, generated from a provided context. 
I need you to evaluate these questions and refine them based on the following criteria:
1. **Ambiguity Removal**: Ensure there is only one clear and correct answer for each question. If multiple correct answers are possible, revise the question and options to remove ambiguity.
2. **Suitability**: Filter out questions that are overly specific or unsuitable for a quiz. For example, questions asking for results of specific experiments (e.g., 'What was the result of experiment 12.2?') are not appropriate unless they test general understanding.
3. **Option Quality**: Ensure that the incorrect options (distractors) are plausible but clearly wrong. Adjust them if necessary to improve the quality of the quiz.
4. **Answer Position**: Make sure correct answer is distributed uniformly and randomly through out first to fourth position option, you can scuffle the generated options to obtain this.
5. **Option Addition**: If given quiz included multiple correct answers you can also add options like all of the above, both 1 and 2 and like that, you can also remove the correct answer and give none of the above option.

Return the **10 best and most suitable** quiz questions, each with 4 options and only 1 correct answer. Make sure the correct answer is clearly identifiable based on the context.

QUERY_MODIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant tasked with refining user questions to improve the retrieval of relevant documents from a vector database. Based on the chat history and the latest user question, your goal is to generate multiple reformulated questions that enhance search relevance.

# Instructions
1. **Incorporate Context**: If the latest question refers to previous chat history, incorporate the relevant context into the reformulated version. If not, keep the original question unchanged.
2. **Preserve Details**: Ensure that the first reformulated question maintains any specific details or formatting requested by the user, such as numbers (e.g., "5 advantages") or structure (e.g., bullet points). Do not remove or alter these elements.
3. **Generate Variations**: After reformulating (or keeping) the first question, provide five additional variations of the query to approach the same topic from different angles.

# Constraints
- The first reformulated question must either integrate the chat history or remain identical to the original if no context is needed, including maintaining any specific details or formatting.
- Do not add any new information or alter the meaning of the original question in the first reformulation.
- The remaining five questions should explore different ways of asking about the same topic.
